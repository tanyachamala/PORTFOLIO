            PROJECTS
            Blood Bank Data Analysis (Using Hadoop)
            Data analysis of the blood bank data set is performed using Cloudera which runs Hadoop in the cloud.
            Hive and Hive QL statements have been used for querying the data.
            Data visualization has been done by extracting the output of the HIVE query in excel and plotting the data using
            line and scatter plot charts. The visualization of the data shows some patterns that exist between blood availability,
            number of donations, minimum volume given and taken and so forth.
            Online Product Quantization (using Java MySQL)
            We have presented our online PQ method to accommodate streaming data. In addition, we employ two budget
            constraints to facilitate partial codebook update to further alleviate the update time cost.
            A relative loss bound has been derived to guarantee the performance of our model. In addition, we propose an online
            PQ over sliding window approach, to emphasize on the real-time data.
            Experimental results show that our method is significantly faster in accommodating the streaming data, outperforms
            the competing online hashing methods and unsupervised batch mode hashing method in terms of search accuracy and
            update time cost, and attains comparable search quality with batch mode PQ.
